# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python.

## Introduction

Hangman is a word guessing game where players attempt to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. The game provides a limited number of lives, and players lose lives for each incorrect guess. The objective is to guess the word before running out of lives.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays the current state of the word with underscores for unknown letters.
- Tracks the number of lives and ends the game when lives run out.
- ASCII art representation of the hangman for each incorrect guess.

## Implementation
- I've learned to make ths game using python implementing my journey through Angela Yu Python's 100 days of Code
- Here in this have mentioned lots of comments as making it step by step process.
- Enjoy playing 🙌😁
